public and private variables can be inherited without no bullshi

however to USE them (reassign and reference) in scripts that inherit them, they must be protected (for private) or virtual/abstract (for public?)

"both virtual and abstract allows us to declare a function that can be overwritten by a Subclass. The difference is:
abstract you MUST override to be used in a Subclass, virtual has a default in the Superclass"
